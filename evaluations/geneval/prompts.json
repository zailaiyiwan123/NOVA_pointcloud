    "prompt": "a photo of a brown knife and a blue donut",
    "dense_prompt": "The style of the image is a real photo. In this detailed and vivid composition, the focus is on a brown knife and a blue donut. The knife, characterized by a sleek wooden handle, rests partially atop the donut, suggesting it's either just been used or is about to be. The blade of the knife glistens slightly, indicating a sharp, well-maintained metal surface. The donut, contrastingly playful in appearance, features a rich, deep blue icing that covers its fluffy, golden-brown base. The icing is sprinkled with a variety of colorful, tiny candy bits, adding a texture that is both visually appealing and suggests a crunchy contrast to the soft dough beneath. This culinary duo is placed on a simple, matte surface that doesn't distract from the subjects. The background is softly blurred, ensuring that the attention remains on the knife and donut, highlighting the simplicity of the composition while emphasizing the rich textures and colors of the central elements."

    "prompt": "a photo of a red cup and a pink handbag",
    "dense_prompt": "The style of the image is a real photo. A vibrant red cup, with a glossy finish reflecting ambient light, sits prominently towards the right of the frame. It is placed on a flat surface, possibly a wooden table given the texture, and is filled with a dark liquid, likely coffee or tea, judging by the steam gently rising from the top. Adjacent to the cup, occupying the central portion of the image, is a pink handbag. This handbag features a soft, leather-like material with visible grain texture, suggesting high-quality craftsmanship. It has silver accents, such as buckles and clasps, which complement its otherwise minimalist design. The bag is semi-open, revealing a patterned inner lining and perhaps a glimpse of items inside\u2014like a wallet or small notebook. Resting next to the bag is a light, possibly metallic pen and a folded newspaper or magazine. The background is softly blurred, in hues of light browns and grays, ensuring the focus remains on the red cup and the pink handbag in the foreground."

    "dense_prompt": "The style of the image is a real photo. A yellow bicycle occupies the left foreground, featuring a slender frame, a standard seat, and straight handlebars with black grips. It stands on its kickstand against a light gray cement pavement.

Behind these vehicles, the background reveals a blurred city scene with indistinct shapes of buildings and faded street lights, suggesting an urban environment. The overall lighting is soft and diffused, with a hint of afternoon sunshine enhancing the vivid colors of the bicycle and motorcycle. The concrete surface under the vehicles shows specks of scattered stones and small debris, adding a realistic touch to the setting."

    "dense_prompt": "The style of the image is a real photo depicting a still life arrangement on a smooth, reflective surface. On the left, there is a bright red orange cut in half, revealing its vibrant, juicy pulp and neatly arranged citrus segments. The texture of the orange's pulp is slightly glistening, indicating freshness. Beside the orange, sits a purple broccoli, which contrasts strikingly in color and texture. The broccoli appears with dense, tightly-packed florets that have a granular feel, and its overall hue is a deep, rich purple. Both are positioned against a plain, unfocused background that enhances their colors, making them pop vividly. On the surface beneath the fruits and vegetable, there is a subtle reflection visible, suggesting the surface is glossy. The composition centers these items in the middle of the frame, drawing the viewer's attention directly to them. There is no additional decoration or elements, focusing solely on these two items and their intriguing color contrast and textural interplay."

    "dense_prompt": "The style of the image is a real photo, presenting a vivid and unusual juxtaposition. At the forefront, an orange traffic light radiates a luminous glow, positioned on the left side. Its casing is metallic and cylindrical, attached to a pole that extends upwards out of view. On the right, occupying a slightly more substantial portion of the image, stands a pristine white toilet with a closed lid. The toilet's design is sleek and modern, featuring a smooth, reflective surface that suggests it is made of ceramic. The background is blurred, focusing attention on these two primary objects, yet hints at an urban setting with indistinct shapes resembling buildings. The colors in the photo are striking, with the deep orange hue of the traffic light contrasting sharply against the stark white of the toilet, both objects illuminated under what appears to be natural daylight conditions. No people are visible in the frame, putting an emphasis entirely on the inanimate objects and their unexpected combination in a single scene."

    "dense_prompt": "The style of the image is a real photo. In the foreground, a vivid green ceramic cup is situated to the left, its surface smooth and glossy.

The composition of the image emphasizes the contrast between the green cup and the red-toned pizza, drawing the viewer's attention directly to these main items. The lighting in the photo is soft, evenly illuminating the scene without harsh shadows, enhancing the vivid colors and making the textures of the pizza's toppings and the smoothness of the cup appear more pronounced."
